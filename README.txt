MODEL NAME:
    PyABM - an agent-based modeling toolkit.
 
DESCRIPTION:
    'PyABM' is an agent-based modeling toolkit written to simplify coding and 
    running agent-based models int he Python programming language. PyABM 
    includes tools to output model results (as text files, plots or ESRI 
    shapefiles), and has a parameter handling system to ease the process of 
    model testing and validation, and of running multiple scenarios with 
    varying model parameters.

    The model was constructed by Alex Zvoleff as part of his dissertation 
    research at San Diego State University (SDSU) in the Department of 
    Geography. Contact Alex Zvoleff or Prof. Li An at SDSU with any questions.
