PyABM INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

DEPENDENCIES
        PyABM has been tested to be functional on Linux, Windows 7, and 
    Mac OS 10.6.4. The toolkit needs a standard Python installation (2.7 has 
    been tested to be working) along with several Python dependencies.
    
    Dependencies:
        Python:
            A python installation is required to use the toolkit. I use Python 
        2.7, but 2.6 and 2.5 should work as well. The toolkit will not run 
        under Python 3.0.

        Python Dependencies:
            Numpy - Numpy is required.

            Matplotlib - Matplotlib is required (to enable the automatic 
            plotting of the results of each model run).

            OGR (optional) - OGR is required to output shapefiles of 
            neighborhoods locations

        R and R packages (optional):
                Several R scripts are used in producing model results initialize 
            the model, to generate synthetic populations to be used for running 
            the model (if the ICPSR restricted data from the CVFS survey is 
            unavailable), and for automated plotting of model results. If you 
            do not have R installed, you will need to set the parameter 
            "make_plots" to "False" in your PyABMrc file.

        Git (optional)

MODEL INSTALLATION
        To get the toolkit, simply download the latest stable version of the 
    code from:
        http://rohan.sdsu.edu/~zvoleff/research/PyABM.php

    The development snapshot (latest version of the code, but it may not always 
    be functional) can be downloaded from:
        http://git.azvoleff.com/PyABM/snapshot

    The development source can also be downloaded via git from:
        git://git.azvoleff.com/PyABM

        To install the PyABM toolkit, simply unzip the code into a folder on 
    your computer.  After installing Python and the dependencies listed above, 
    you will need to add the folder containing the model to your computer's 
    Python path so that the code modules will load correctly.

    Adding PyABM directory to Python path on Linux and Mac OS:
            On Linux and Mac OS, you will need to add a line to your user 
        profile telling Python where the PyABM files are located. You can 
        do this one of two ways. To temporarily add the PyABM path to your 
        Python path, open XTerm and type:
            export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/PyABM/folder
        Replace "/path/to/PyABM/folder" with the correct full path to the 
        PyABM folder. For example, if the code is on your desktop, this 
        might be "/Users/azvoleff/Desktop/PyABM" on a Mac, or 
        "/home/azvoleff/Desktop/PyABM" on Linux.

        To make this change permanent, add the line
            export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/PyABM/folder
        to the ".profile" file in your home directory.
